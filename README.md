Follow the on-screen prompts to select and run a specific workflow.

## Implementation Overview

The system implements different workflow patterns for content repurposing using LLM function calling. The main components include:

1. **LLM Interface**: Abstracts API calls to different LLM providers
2. **Task Functions**: Specialized functions for extracting key points, generating summaries, etc.
3. **Workflow Implementations**: Various patterns including pipelines, DAGs, and agent-based systems
4. **Evaluation Functions**: Methods to assess and improve content quality through reflection

The implementation uses the OpenAI client library with custom base URLs to support different model providers like Groq.

## Workflow Types

### 1. Pipeline Workflow
A linear sequence of tasks where each step feeds into the next. Tasks are executed in a fixed order:
1. Extract key points
2. Generate summary
3. Create social media posts
4. Create email newsletter

### 2. DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) Workflow
A more flexible workflow where tasks can run in parallel if they don't depend on each other. For example, social media posts and email newsletter creation can run concurrently after key points and summary are generated.

### 3. Chain-of-Thought Key Point Extraction
An enhancement focused on improving key point extraction through step-by-step reasoning, asking the model to:
1. Identify main themes
2. Determine important claims/arguments
3. Consider supporting evidence
4. Extract practical implications

### 4. Reflexion Workflow
A self-improving workflow that uses evaluation and feedback loops to enhance content quality:
1. Generate initial content
2. Evaluate quality and get feedback
3. Improve content based on feedback
4. Repeat until quality threshold is reached or max attempts exhausted

### 5. Agent-Driven Workflow
A more autonomous workflow where the LLM decides which tools to use and in what order:
1. Agent receives blog post
2. Agent chooses appropriate tools to analyze and repurpose content
3. Agent determines workflow sequence dynamically
4. Agent completes the task when all necessary outputs are generated

## Example Outputs

Here are sample outputs from the different workflow types based on a blog post about "The Impact of Artificial Intelligence on Modern Healthcare":

### Pipeline Workflow Results
```
key_points: ['Artificial intelligence (AI) is revolutionizing the healthcare industry.', 'AI applications include predictive analytics, robotic surgery, diagnostic imaging, drug discovery, and personalized medicine.', 'AI-driven imaging technologies improve disease detection accuracy and speed results analysis.', 'Predictive analytics help identify disease risks, forecast patient readmissions, and track disease outbreaks.', 'AI accelerates drug discovery by analyzing biological data and predicting drug interactions.', 'Personalized medicine uses AI to tailor treatments based on genetic information and lifestyle factors.', 'AI-powered virtual assistants and chatbots enhance patient engagement and provide medical guidance.', 'AI presents challenges such as data privacy, algorithm bias, regulatory approval, and integration issues.', 'The future of healthcare requires a harmonious integration of AI and human care for optimal outcomes.']
```

### DAG Workflow Results
```
key_points: ['AI revolutionizing healthcare', 'Machine learning, natural language processing, and robotics driving advancements', 'Diagnostic imaging with AI improving accuracy and speed', 'Predictive analytics for risk assessment and disease outbreak tracking', 'Accelerating drug discovery through AI analysis of biological data', 'Personalized medicine based on genetic information and lifestyle factors', 'AI-powered virtual assistants improving patient engagement and basic medical guidance', 'Challenges in implementation such as data privacy, algorithm bias, and regulatory approval']

summary: AI is rapidly transforming healthcare through advancements like machine learning, natural language processing, and robotics. It enhances diagnostic imaging accuracy, speeds up risk assessment for disease outbreaks, accelerates drug discovery, and personalizes medicine based on genetic data. AI-powered virtual assistants also improve patient engagement. However, implementation challenges include data privacy concerns, algorithm bias, and regulatory approval.
```

### Reflexion Workflow
The output shows multiple improvement attempts with quality scoring:
```
Extracting key points with reflexion...
Initial key_points generated. Evaluating quality...
Quality score: 0.7
Attempting to improve key_points (attempt 1/3)...
Feedback: The content lacks specificity in key points which are critical for evaluating comprehensiveness, clarity, and importance.
Quality score: 0.6
```

### Agent-Driven Workflow
```
Starting agent-driven workflow...
Agent iteration 1/10
Agent is using tool: extract_key_points
Agent iteration 2/10
Agent is using tool: extract_key_points
Agent iteration 3/10
Agent did not call any tools. Workflow complete.
```

## Effectiveness Analysis

### Pipeline Workflow
**Strengths**: Simple to implement and understand. Each step has a clear input and output.  
**Weaknesses**: Lacks flexibility. Cannot adapt to different content types or quality issues.  
**Best for**: Straightforward content repurposing tasks with well-defined steps.

### DAG Workflow
**Strengths**: More efficient than pipelines due to parallel task execution. More flexible for complex workflows.  
**Weaknesses**: More complex to implement and manage dependencies.  
**Best for**: Workflows with independent tasks that can benefit from parallel processing.

### Chain-of-Thought Approach
**Strengths**: Produces higher quality key points by encouraging structured reasoning.  
**Weaknesses**: More computationally expensive and time-consuming.  
**Best for**: Complex content where careful analysis is needed to identify truly important points.

### Reflexion Workflow
**Strengths**: Self-improving results through feedback loops. Can achieve higher quality content.  
**Weaknesses**: Most time-consuming approach. May not converge to better results in all cases.  
**Best for**: High-stakes content where quality is paramount and processing time is less critical.

### Agent-Driven Workflow
**Strengths**: Most flexible approach. Can adapt to different content types and requirements.  
**Weaknesses**: Results can be unpredictable. Complex to debug when issues arise.  
**Best for**: Novel content types or when the optimal workflow isn't known in advance.

Based on the output analysis, the DAG workflow appears to produce the most comprehensive and well-structured content, with good balance between efficiency and quality. The Reflexion workflow showed inconsistent improvement attempts, suggesting that automated evaluation and revision may need refinement.

## Challenges and Solutions

### Challenge 1: Quality Assessment
**Problem**: Automatically evaluating content quality is difficult and subjective.  
**Solution**: Used a scoring system (0-1) with specific feedback for different content types. However, this still showed inconsistency in the Reflexion workflow.

### Challenge 2: Error Handling
**Problem**: The code showed error handling issues, particularly in the Chain-of-Thought workflow.  
**Solution**: Implemented fallback mechanisms for when tool calling fails, ensuring the workflow can continue even if a specific step encounters an error.

### Challenge 3: Workflow Completion
**Problem**: The agent-based workflow sometimes fails to complete within the maximum iterations.  
**Solution**: Added a warning message and returned partial results rather than failing completely.

### Challenge 4: Dependency Management
**Problem**: Managing dependencies between tasks in more complex workflows.  
**Solution**: In the DAG implementation, clearly defined which outputs from earlier tasks are required as inputs for later tasks.

### Challenge 5: Function Results Consistency
**Problem**: Different content generation functions return results in different formats.  
**Solution**: Standardized the return values from tool functions and implemented proper error checking to ensure consistent integration between workflow steps.
